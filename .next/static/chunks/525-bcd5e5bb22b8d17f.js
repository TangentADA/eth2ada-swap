In a proof-of-stake system, validators (also called "stakers" or "forgers") are chosen to create new blocks and verify transactions based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and "stake" as collateral.\n\nIn a PoS system, validators are required to put up a certain amount of cryptocurrency (such as Cardano or Ethereum) as a security deposit, or "stake." This stake serves as collateral to ensure that validators act honestly and follow the rules of the network, because if they act maliciously or attempt to compromise the network, they risk losing their stake.\n\nThe process of selecting validators in a PoS system can be done in different ways, such as through random selection or based on the size of a validator\'s stake. Once a validator is selected to create a new block, they are responsible for adding valid transactions to the block and broadcasting it to the network. Other validators then validate the block and add it to the blockchain if it meets the consensus rules.\n\nOverall, PoS is seen as a more energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly alternative to the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm used by Bitcoin, because it does not require validators to solve complex mathematical problems in order to add new blocks to the blockchain.',description:"In Cardano, PoS stands for \"Proof of Stake,\" which is the consensus algorithm used by the Cardano blockchain to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain.

These validators are responsible for adding valid transactions to the blocks and maintaining the network's security and integrity.\n\nCardano's PoS system has several advantages over other consensus mechanisms, such as PoW (Proof of Work), used by Bitcoin. PoS requires significantly less energy consumption than PoW because validators do not need to solve complex mathematical problems in order to create new blocks. This makes Cardano a more environmentally-friendly and energy-efficient blockchain.\n\nMoreover, Cardano's PoS system also helps prevent centralization by ensuring that no single validator has too much control over the network.

This ensures that if an unauthorized person gains access to the ciphertext, they will not be able to understand its contents without the decryption key.\n\nThere are many different encryption algorithms, ranging from simple ones like Caesar Cipher to more complex ones like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) or RSA (Rivest\u2013Shamir\u2013Adleman). These algorithms use different techniques and mathematical functions to scramble the data and make it unreadable to anyone who does not have the correct key.\n\nEncryption is an important tool in ensuring data privacy and security in the digital age, and it is used widely in industries such as finance, healthcare, and government.',description:"Encryption plays a key role in the security of the Cardano blockchain.

However, in 2021, Ethereum underwent a major upgrade called Ethereum 2.0, which fully replaced PoW with PoS and implemented the Casper protocol.\n\nOverall, Casper is an important part of the ongoing development of the Ethereum blockchain, helping to make it more energy-efficient, secure, and scalable, and to enable a wide range of decentralized applications and smart contracts.",description:"---",id:"term_16",image:"/images/blog/term_6.jpg",date:"23 Dec",time:"3 min read",subImages:["/images/blog/gallery_1.jpg","/images/blog/gallery_2.jpg"],authorImage:"/images/logo-circle.png",authorName:"Eth2Ada Academy"},{title:"Aiken",descriptionAda:"---",description:"Aiken is a new programming language and toolkit for developing smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain.

Stake pools are registered on-chain, and their on-chain data (such as information required to calculate rewards) is critical to the operation of the ledger. Stake pools also possess metadata that helps users to make a rational choice of a stake pool to delegate to. This metadata is stored off-chain, as it might reflect sensitive content. Such an approach allows for a certain degree of decentralized censorship.\n\nBut on the other hand, off-chain metadata storage poses a challenge of open access by different users. On-chain stake pool registrations contain an URL pointer to the off-chain metadata and a content hash that can be fetched from a specific stake pool.

Cardano implements an innovative Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTXO) model, which is introduced by the Alonzo upgrade to support multi-assets and smart contracts.\n\nhe EUTXO model extends the UTXO model in two ways:\n\nIt generalizes the concept of \u2018address\u2019 by using the lock-and-key analogy. Instead of restricting locks to public keys and keys to signatures, addresses in the EUTXO model can contain arbitrary logic in the form of scripts. For example, when a node validates a transaction, the node determines whether or not the transaction is allowed to use a certain output as an input. The transaction will look up the script provided by the output's address and will execute the script if the transaction can use the output as an input.\nThe second difference between UTXO and EUTXO is that outputs can carry (almost) arbitrary data in addition to an address and value. This makes scripts much more powerful by allowing them to carry state information.\nFurthermore, EUTXO extends the UTXO model by allowing output addresses to contain complex logic to decide which transactions can unlock them, and by adding custom data to all outputs. When validating an address, the script will access the data being carried by the output, the transaction being validated, and some additional pieces of data called redeemers, which the transaction provides for every input. By looking up all this information, the script has enough context to give a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 answer in what can be highly complex situations and use cases.\n\nEUTXO enables arbitrary logic in the form of scripts.

They can be run in both directions on the same TCP connection to allow for peer-to-peer (P2P) settings.\n\nThe overall protocol -and each mini-protocol- is designed for a trustless setting where both sides need to guard against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. For example, each mini-protocol uses consumer-driven control flow, so a node only requests more work when it is ready, rather than having work pushed upon it.\n\nThe protocol design is modular and evolvable: version negotiation is used to agree on the set of mini-protocols to use, which allows additional or updated mini-protocols to be added over time without causing compatibility issues.",id:"term_55",image:"/images/blog/term_6.jpg",date:"23 Dec",time:"3 min read",subImages:["/images/blog/gallery_1.jpg","/images/blog/gallery_2.jpg"],authorImage:"/images/logo-circle.png",authorName:"Eth2Ada Academy"},{title:"Node-to-Client IPC",descriptionAda:"---",description:"The purpose of the node-to-client IPC protocol is to allow local applications to interact with the blockchain via the node. This includes applications such as wallet backends or blockchain explorers. The node-to-client protocol enables these applications to access the raw chain data and to query the current ledger state. It also provides the ability to submit new transactions to the system.\n\nThe node-to-client protocol uses the same design as the node-to-node protocol, but with a different set of mini-protocols, and using local pipes rather than TCP connections. As such, it is a relatively low-level narrow interface that exposes only what the node can provide natively. For example, the node provides access to all the raw chain data but does not provide a way to query data on the chain. The job of providing data services and more convenient higher level APIs is delegated to dedicated clients, such as cardano-db-sync and the wallet backend.\n\nThe node-to-client protocol consists of three mini-protocols:\n\nchain-sync: Used for following the chain and getting blocks\nlocal-tx-submission: Used for submitting transactions\nlocal-state-query: Used for querying the ledger state\nThe node-to-client version of chain sync uses full blocks, rather than just block headers. This is why no separate block-fetch protocol is needed. The local-tx-submission protocol is like the node-to-node tx-submission protocol but simpler, and it returns the details of transaction validation failures. The local state query protocol provides query access to the current ledger state, which contains a lot of interesting data that is not directly reflected on the chain itself.",id:"term_56",image:"/images/blog/term_6.jpg",date:"23 Dec",time:"3 min read",subImages:["/images/blog/gallery_1.jpg","/images/blog/gallery_2.jpg"],authorImage:"/images/logo-circle.png",authorName:"Eth2Ada Academy"},{title:"Helios",descriptionAda:"---",description:"A simple C-like smart contract language for Cardano.
