		description: 'Means unspent transaction output. Every address on Cardano is filled with UTxO (unless the address has 0 funds). These UTxOs are products of transactions that deposited money into the address. They are then used to spend money from the address, which consumes the UTxO and delivers funds to another address (and a new UTxO for any remaining balance from current UTxO). An address can be full of many UTxOs. An individual address will not have one UTxO for all possessed funds. This is contrary to Ethereum, which uses an account-based model, like bank accounts. In an account-based model, an address simply has funds, and some is subtracted when money is spent. This is not how Bitcoin or Cardano works because they use the UTxO model.

		description: 'On Ethereum, smart contracts life on the blockchain as code that performs specific action. This is not how Cardano smart contracts work. It is helpful to think of smart contracts on Cardano as validator scripts. When a smart contract is written, it is turned into a policy script file, containing a hash that represents the code. The contact was full of parameters that legitimize a transaction. So, when a policy script is attached to a transaction on Cardano, it will only go through if all the conditions of the transaction meet the criteria of the smart contract. Therefore, more complicated functions can be performed on Cardano, because there are policy scripts that are regulating the legitimacy of these transactions.',

Rather than requiring energy to validate blocks, Cardano uses the proof of stake (POS) systems require the ownership of the blockchains cryptocurrency to validate blocks.

		description: 'Collateral, similar to gas on Ethereum, are in place to prevent denial of service attacks. However, contrary to gas fees, it is uncommon (rare in fact) for them to be spent. Cardano has a two-phase validation process. The first phase checks if a transaction is constructed correctly. Phase 2 cruns the script included within a transaction. Phase 1, when validated by the blockchain, requires resources and therefore extracts a fee. If phase 1 passes but phase 2 does not, the collateral is consumed to compensate the nodes for effort. However, it is typical for phase 1 to fail if the transaction is not correct and does not fit parameters of script. It is my understanding that it would take a lot of deliberate effort to spend collateral (have phase 1 pass but phase 2 not).

		descriptionETH: "PoS stands for \"Proof of Stake,\" which is a type of consensus algorithm used by some blockchain networks to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. In a proof-of-stake system, validators (also called \"stakers\" or \"forgers\") are chosen to create new blocks and verify transactions based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and \"stake\" as collateral.\n\nIn a PoS system, validators are required to put up a certain amount of cryptocurrency (such as Cardano or Ethereum) as a security deposit, or \"stake.\" This stake serves as collateral to ensure that validators act honestly and follow the rules of the network, because if they act maliciously or attempt to compromise the network, they risk losing their stake.\n\nThe process of selecting validators in a PoS system can be done in different ways, such as through random selection or based on the size of a validator's stake. Once a validator is selected to create a new block, they are responsible for adding valid transactions to the block and broadcasting it to the network. Other validators then validate the block and add it to the blockchain if it meets the consensus rules.\n\nOverall, PoS is seen as a more energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly alternative to the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm used by Bitcoin, because it does not require validators to solve complex mathematical problems in order to add new blocks to the blockchain.",
		description: "In Cardano, PoS stands for \"Proof of Stake,\" which is the consensus algorithm used by the Cardano blockchain to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. Cardano's PoS consensus algorithm is called Ouroboros and it was specifically designed to be secure, energy-efficient, and scalable.\n\nIn Cardano's PoS system, validators, also known as \"stakeholders\", are randomly selected to create new blocks and validate transactions based on the amount of ADA cryptocurrency they have \"staked\" or locked up as collateral. These validators are responsible for adding valid transactions to the blocks and maintaining the network's security and integrity.\n\nCardano's PoS system has several advantages over other consensus mechanisms, such as PoW (Proof of Work), used by Bitcoin. PoS requires significantly less energy consumption than PoW because validators do not need to solve complex mathematical problems in order to create new blocks. This makes Cardano a more environmentally-friendly and energy-efficient blockchain.\n\nMoreover, Cardano's PoS system also helps prevent centralization by ensuring that no single validator has too much control over the network. Validators are incentivized to act honestly because they risk losing their staked ADA if they act maliciously.\n\nOverall, Cardano's PoS algorithm is a crucial component of the network's design, and it is one of the reasons why Cardano has become a popular and promising blockchain platform.",

These slot leaders are responsible for creating new blocks and verifying transactions, and they are incentivized to act honestly because they have staked their own ADA.\n\nThe Ouroboros algorithm uses a cryptographic technique called a verifiable random function (VRF) to ensure that the selection of slot leaders is fair and unpredictable. This helps to prevent any single entity from dominating the network, which could lead to centralization and compromise the security of the blockchain.\n\nOverall, the Ouroboros algorithm is designed to be highly secure, energy-efficient, and scalable, and it has been recognized for its innovative approach to consensus in the blockchain space.",

Encryption is commonly used for secure communication, storage of sensitive information, and protecting data privacy.\n\nThe encrypted data, or \"ciphertext,\" can only be decrypted and turned back into plaintext by someone who has the correct key or password, which is typically only known by the intended recipient. This ensures that if an unauthorized person gains access to the ciphertext, they will not be able to understand its contents without the decryption key.\n\nThere are many different encryption algorithms, ranging from simple ones like Caesar Cipher to more complex ones like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) or RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman). These algorithms use different techniques and mathematical functions to scramble the data and make it unreadable to anyone who does not have the correct key.\n\nEncryption is an important tool in ensuring data privacy and security in the digital age, and it is used widely in industries such as finance, healthcare, and government.",
		description: "Encryption plays a key role in the security of the Cardano blockchain. Cardano uses encryption to protect the privacy of user data and transactions, ensuring that sensitive information is kept confidential and secure.\n\nFor instance, when a user sends an ADA cryptocurrency transaction on the Cardano blockchain, the transaction is encrypted using advanced cryptographic algorithms to ensure that only the intended recipient can access the transaction details. This protects the user's privacy and helps prevent unauthorized access to their funds or personal information.\n\nCardano also uses encryption to secure its wallets and keys. Wallets are used to store and manage cryptocurrency on the Cardano blockchain, and they are protected by strong encryption methods to prevent unauthorized access. Keys are used to sign and verify transactions on the blockchain, and they are also encrypted to ensure their security.\n\nIn addition, Cardano's consensus algorithm, Ouroboros, uses advanced encryption methods to secure the network and protect against attacks. Ouroboros relies on complex mathematical functions and cryptographic protocols to ensure that transactions are validated and added to the blockchain in a secure and trustworthy way.\n\nOverall, encryption is an essential component of the Cardano blockchain, helping to ensure the security and privacy of users' data and transactions, and maintaining the integrity of the network.",

Instead of miners competing to solve complex mathematical problems to add new blocks to the blockchain, validators stake their ETH cryptocurrency to participate in the consensus process. Validators are randomly selected to create new blocks, and their staked ETH serves as collateral to ensure they act honestly and do not attempt to compromise the network.\n\nThe Casper protocol was originally intended to be implemented as a hybrid PoW\/PoS system, with PoW used to validate transactions initially and PoS used to finalize the blocks. However, in 2021, Ethereum underwent a major upgrade called Ethereum 2.0, which fully replaced PoW with PoS and implemented the Casper protocol.\n\nOverall, Casper is an important part of the ongoing development of the Ethereum blockchain, helping to make it more energy-efficient, secure, and scalable, and to enable a wide range of decentralized applications and smart contracts.",

The functionality provided by SMASH supports stake pool operations and the delegation ecosystem with its standardized framework for listing valid stake pools with verified metadata.\n\nCardano Shelley introduced the concept of stake pools - reliable server nodes that keep an aggregated stake of pool operators and delegators in a single entity. Stake pools are registered on-chain, and their on-chain data (such as information required to calculate rewards) is critical to the operation of the ledger. Stake pools also possess metadata that helps users to make a rational choice of a stake pool to delegate to. This metadata is stored off-chain, as it might reflect sensitive content. Such an approach allows for a certain degree of decentralized censorship.\n\nBut on the other hand, off-chain metadata storage poses a challenge of open access by different users. On-chain stake pool registrations contain an URL pointer to the off-chain metadata and a content hash that can be fetched from a specific stake pool. This might cause both performance and privacy issues. Another crucial aspect to address is the stake pool’s “ticker” name, which is the short name a stake pool is recognized by. Ticker names might reflect prominent brands or trademarks that should not be duplicated, as this might lead to confusion. SPOs running multiple pools might want to use the same metadata for all their pools, for example, which might lead to these pools appearing with the same ticker name. This would not be an ideal situation.\n\nTo support stake pool operations and provide visibility over the delegation ecosystem, we have created a Stake Pool Metadata Aggregation Server – SMASH.",

Cardano implements an innovative Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTXO) model, which is introduced by the Alonzo upgrade to support multi-assets and smart contracts.\n\nhe EUTXO model extends the UTXO model in two ways:\n\nIt generalizes the concept of ‘address’ by using the lock-and-key analogy. Instead of restricting locks to public keys and keys to signatures, addresses in the EUTXO model can contain arbitrary logic in the form of scripts. For example, when a node validates a transaction, the node determines whether or not the transaction is allowed to use a certain output as an input. The transaction will look up the script provided by the output's address and will execute the script if the transaction can use the output as an input.\nThe second difference between UTXO and EUTXO is that outputs can carry (almost) arbitrary data in addition to an address and value. This makes scripts much more powerful by allowing them to carry state information.\nFurthermore, EUTXO extends the UTXO model by allowing output addresses to contain complex logic to decide which transactions can unlock them, and by adding custom data to all outputs. When validating an address, the script will access the data being carried by the output, the transaction being validated, and some additional pieces of data called redeemers, which the transaction provides for every input. By looking up all this information, the script has enough context to give a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer in what can be highly complex situations and use cases.\n\nEUTXO enables arbitrary logic in the form of scripts. This arbitrary logic inspects the transaction and the data to decide whether the transaction is allowed to use an input or not.\n",

		descriptionETH: "Solidity is a high-level programming language that is used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. Solidity is a contract-oriented language, meaning it is specifically designed for writing smart contracts.\n\nSolidity is similar in syntax to JavaScript and C++, and it is compiled into bytecode that can be executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Solidity provides a range of features and functionality, including support for complex data types, inheritance, and library contracts, as well as security features such as exception handling and function modifiers.\n\nSmart contracts written in Solidity can be used to implement a wide range of decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain-based solutions, such as digital identity systems, supply chain management, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and more.\n\nSolidity is one of the most popular programming languages used for smart contract development on the Ethereum blockchain, and it has a large and active developer community. However, it is important to note that Solidity has some limitations and vulnerabilities, and it is essential for developers to follow best practices and ensure the security and reliability of their code.",

		description: "Concurrency may or may not improve a system’s performance, throughput, or responsiveness. The amount of concurrency limits the maximum number of simultaneous operations that can be performed.\n\nTo obtain actual performance improvements in a UTXO-based blockchain, processors or other actors should be able to perform multiple actions simultaneously. The higher the level of concurrency, the higher the maximum possible parallelism. Such an approach then translates to performance improvements and throughput. It also provides significant advantages over account based systems (like Ethereum).\n\nDeploying DApps on UTXO ledgers is different\nCardano’s approach to DApp deployment is different and thus it requires a learning curve and a different approach. This is like working with different programming languages: there is one goal – to deploy a solution, but so many programming languages to use for this purpose.\n\nMaximizing concurrency is a skill that needs to be learned: developers need to write code in a way that severely restricts the opportunities for contention (e.g., by avoiding shared states and accidental dependencies). The system must then translate this concurrency into parallelism. A number of developers have already identified ways to approach this, while others are still developing solutions. Simply transplanting lessons learned on one blockchain will not work; while the learning curve is a little steeper, the results make this worthwhile.\n\nEither way, it is important to understand that to deploy a scalable DApp on Cardano, a developer can’t just use an adapted Ethereum contract. Cardano is based on the UTXO model; it is not account-based which means that a single on-chain state will not meet the concurrency property of Cardano. Instead, DApps should split up their on-chain state across many UTXOs. This will increase the concurrency in their application, thereby allowing higher throughput.\n\nTo learn more about scalability, you can read how to design a scalable Plutus application and to learn more about how to organise DApps on Cardano using patterns, read the order book pattern.",

They can be run in both directions on the same TCP connection to allow for peer-to-peer (P2P) settings.\n\nThe overall protocol -and each mini-protocol- is designed for a trustless setting where both sides need to guard against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. For example, each mini-protocol uses consumer-driven control flow, so a node only requests more work when it is ready, rather than having work pushed upon it.\n\nThe protocol design is modular and evolvable: version negotiation is used to agree on the set of mini-protocols to use, which allows additional or updated mini-protocols to be added over time without causing compatibility issues.",

It also provides the ability to submit new transactions to the system.\n\nThe node-to-client protocol uses the same design as the node-to-node protocol, but with a different set of mini-protocols, and using local pipes rather than TCP connections. As such, it is a relatively low-level narrow interface that exposes only what the node can provide natively. For example, the node provides access to all the raw chain data but does not provide a way to query data on the chain. The job of providing data services and more convenient higher level APIs is delegated to dedicated clients, such as cardano-db-sync and the wallet backend.\n\nThe node-to-client protocol consists of three mini-protocols:\n\nchain-sync: Used for following the chain and getting blocks\nlocal-tx-submission: Used for submitting transactions\nlocal-state-query: Used for querying the ledger state\nThe node-to-client version of chain sync uses full blocks, rather than just block headers. This is why no separate block-fetch protocol is needed. The local-tx-submission protocol is like the node-to-node tx-submission protocol but simpler, and it returns the details of transaction validation failures. The local state query protocol provides query access to the current ledger state, which contains a lot of interesting data that is not directly reflected on the chain itself.",
